# Essentials:
- infrared transmitter (LASER like beams)
- infrared receivers for hit recognition
- low freq (maybe 400mhz, maybe 900) telemetrie to groundstation
- groundstation that count points

# pretty nice to have
- microcontroller in the RC vehicle that counts healthpoints and ammo count
- analog OSD module that replaces or complements the original OSD chip and shows health, ammo etc
